**Why this matters**: This information matters because it introduces us to important info about Node.js and presents some context and background for pair programming.

**1. What is node.js?**

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It's an event-based, non-blocking asynchronous I/O runtime using Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.


**2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?**

It's an open-source engine that runs in Chrome and compiles JavaScript code to your computer's native code so it can execute JS. 

**3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?**

It means that Node.js is a program that can be used to execute JavaScript on a computer.

**4 What is npm?**

It's a package manager that comes bundled with Node. It's also the world's largest software registry, with over 1M packages of JS code available to download.

**4. What version of node are you running on your machine?**

v.19.7.0

**5. What version of npm are you running on your machine?**

9.5.0

**6. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**

`npm install -g jshint` to install globally, `npm init -y` followed by `npm install jshint --save` to install locally to a project.


**7. What is node used for?**

- Installing and running various build tools designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
- As a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks.
- To write your own command line tool.
- To build cross-platform desktop apps.
- To create robots!

**1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**
- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness

**2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
- Engaged collaboration and learning from fellow students

**3. How does pair programming work?**

Pair programming involves two roles: the Driver and Navigator. The Driver types and is the only one with keyboard access. The Driver handles the "mechanics" of the coding and manages the text editor, switching files, version control and writing the code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide direct input to the computer. The Navigator is responsible for looking at the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted into code, and scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator may also look up solutions and documentation.
