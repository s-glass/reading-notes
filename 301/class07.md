**1. Who is Roy Fielding?**

Roy Felding helped to write the first web servers and researched why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

**2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. They were initially designed to communicate between a small group of machines.


**3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

The protocol applys verbs to nouns, in the example from the reading. For example, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and then returns a web page.


**4. What does a GET do?**

It retrieves and displays in the browser the page/site that the URL requested.

**5. What does a POST do?**

Allows one system to add something to another system.

**6. What does PUT do?**

Allows one stystem to replace something in another system.

**7. What does PATCH do?**

Allows one system to do a partial update on another system.
