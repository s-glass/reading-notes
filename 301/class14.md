**1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**

Personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers, and marketing targeted computers almost exclusively to men and boys.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

Because it started to become assumed that computers were made for men and boys. As such, these assumptions were excluding women in school and at work. For example, starting in the 80's, computer science professors started assuming that their students had grown up playing with computers at home - and curriculum therefore catered to students who had that exposure and experience.

## Why diversity matters to your tech industry

**1. When are diversity efforts most successful?**

When they're driven by a commitment from company leaders.

**2. Why do diverse companies perform better?**

Because diverse groups of people bring more and different ways of seeing a problem and thus, faster and better ways of solving it. They are smarter and more creative than homogenous ones.

**3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

The more diverse a company is, the more they could be able to create products and features that consider multiple wants and needs, in addition to having different insights on how to increase engagement and build networks and partnerships in various communities.

An example is that if YouTube had considered the experiences of left handed people when building their iOS app, they could have avoided significant user errors.
