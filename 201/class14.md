**1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**

The `transoform` property brings new ways to position and alter elements, with alternative options for sizing, positioning, and changing elements. 

- By adding vendor prefixes, the element can gain the best support across browsers.

**2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**

One example is a 2D rotate, which could be used to do the same effect that the * in the CSS Tricks logo does on [this page](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/) when you scroll down and back up (it spins around).

**1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**

Transitions allow for the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

**2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**

Transitions create visual interactions for single state changes, and animations build out interactions for multiple states when more control is required.
