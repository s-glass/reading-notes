**Why this matters**: This information matters because it gives us some more functionality with the style and design of our web pages. Styling is a key part to implementing an application, so knowing what more can be done helps the overall quality of a dev's work.

## CSS Transforms
Source: [https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

**1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**

The `transoform` property brings new ways to position and alter elements, with alternative options for sizing, positioning, and changing elements. 

- By adding vendor prefixes, the element can gain the best support across browsers.

**2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**

One example is a 2D rotate, which could be used to do the same effect that the * in the CSS Tricks logo does on [this page](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/) when you scroll down and back up (it spins around).

## CSS Transitions & Animations

**1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**

Transitions allow for the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

**2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**

Transitions create visual interactions for single state changes, and animations build out interactions for multiple states when more control is required.

**2. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?**

Knowing more about CSS features is important to my long term goals as a dev because styling is an imporant part of basic web development, and it's not sufficient to just stick to simple or 'ugly' styling for most web purposes at this stage in the advancement of software development.

## Psychological Safety

Source:[https://web.archive.org/web/20221125192300/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20221125192300/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)


**1 What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?**

- conversational turn-taking
- average social sensitivity (empathy)
- interpersonal trust
- mutual respect
- climate in which people are comfortable being themselves

**2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.**

I want to highlight this quote in the article: “You can instruct employees to be sensitive to how their colleagues feel and to notice when someone seems upset. But the kinds of people who work at Google are often the ones who became software engineers because they wanted to avoid talking about feelings in the first place.”

At a previous job (actually in a few previous roles), I’ve been on teams that had legitimate concerns about race and/or gender inequality, and multiple times I’ve seen senior leadership members dismiss and devalue staff concerns as “just feelings”, inferring that ‘the workplace is no place for feelings.’ That sentiment solidifies that a) only certain feelings are acceptable in the workplace b) your 'feelings' are seen as a threat or challenge, and c) this is not a place where you can bring concerns without repercussions. Author Ruchika Tulshayan talks more on this [here](https://www.rtulshyan.com/post/why-inclusion-cant-exist-without-psychological-safety).

Regarding the quote above, I think it's extra important that people in software development know how to foster psych safety because not only is there a stereotype to overcome pegging devs as lacking in social/emotional skills but also because at the heart of software development is communication and teamwork.


**3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?**

Groups that work well together innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, find better solutions, and also achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction; and psychological safety is key to groups working well.
