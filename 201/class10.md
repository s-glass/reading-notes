# 201 class 10 notes

**Why this matters**: This information matters because debugging is a key part of software development. Becoming skilled at finding issues and fixing them is, in my opinion, as important (if not more) as creating the code in the first place.

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

**1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

- Syntax errors are spelling errors that cause the program not to run at all or stop working partway through. 

- Logic errors are when the syntax is correct but the code is not correct, so the program runs but gives incorrect results. 


**2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

Syntax errors will be the death of me! I make a lot of syntax errors, and a friend who was helping me with a lab said to avoid that, he always directly copies and pastes when referring to previous code to minimize the errors. The majority of the time, I correct errors either by trial and error or with the help of others. Lately, using the console log has helped a lot. 


**3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

I think debugging is a massively important and key part of software development. Becoming skilled at finding issues and fixing them is, in my opinion, as important as creating the code in the first place.

## The JavaScript Debugger

**1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

The JavaScript debugger is a feature of the devtools in your browser. It lets you watch the value of variables and set breakpoints in order to pause execution and identify problems that are holding up proper execution.

**2. Define what a breakpoint is.**

Breakpoint is a tool you can set in the code to pause execution of the code in order to identify problems that are keeping the code from properly executing.


**3. What is the call stack?**

The call stack is a section that shows you what code was executed to get to the current line of code.
