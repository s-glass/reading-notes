**Why this matters**: This information matters because local storage allows developers to maintain the state of an interface and to store web service data (leading to faster loading times), among other things.

## Local Storage And How To Use It On Websites

Source: [https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/)

**1. Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?**

As HTTP is stateless, devs need to store the state of their interface somewhere to preserve its most recent state (and for faster loading times). When storing it server-side isn't an option, you need local storage.

**2. What information should not be stored in local storage?**

Personal information, as local storage can be exploited.

**3 Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?**

Strings! You can convert it using the `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse` methods.
