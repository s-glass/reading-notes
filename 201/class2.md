**Why this matters**: This information matters because it's a review of the basic building blocks for beginning developers, including how browsers and web pages function, and the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**1.** Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?

[This source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) lists the following as some of the benefits of using semantic markup in HTML:

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO.)
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
- Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes.
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.

**2.** How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

There are six heading elements representing six levels of content in a document: h1 through h6.

**3.** What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?

They represent superscript and subscript, which are used for marking up items like dates (ex. 25th), chemical formulas (ex. H20), and math equations (ex. x2 = 9).

**4.** When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

A full expansion of a term in plain text must be provided on first use allong with the <abbr> element wrapped around an abbreviation or acronym.

**1.**What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

- External style sheet
- Internal style sheet
- Inline styles

**2.**Why should we avoid using inline styles?

- It's inefficient when it comes to maintenance, meaning one change may require multiple edits.

- it mixes CSS with HTML and content, which makes it more difficult to read and understand.

**3.** Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:

1. What is representing the selector? **h2**

2. Which components are the CSS declarations? **color: black; and padding: 5px;**

3. Which components are considered properties? **color and padding**

**1.** What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?

A String.


**2.** List 4 types of JavaScript operators.

- Addition: "+"
- Subtraction: "-"
- Assignment: "="
- Strict Equality: "==="

**3.** Describe a real world Problem you could solve with a Function.

**1.** An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.

condition; true


**2.** What is the use of an else if?

It allows you to have more than two choices or outcomes.


**3.** List 3 different types of comparison operators.

- Strict equality: "==="
- Strict non-equality: "!=="
- Greater than: ">"

**4.** What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?

&& - AND allows you to chain together 2 or more expressions so that **all of them** have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.

|| - OR allows you to chain together 2 or more expressions so that **one or more of them** have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
