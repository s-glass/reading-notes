# 201 class 6 notes

**Why this matters**: This information matters because it introduces object syntax in JS, give us information about the Document Object Model (DOM), and includes articles on immutable and mutable data in JS.

## JS Object Basics

Source: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics)

**1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?**

In the JavaScript language, an object is a collection of data that is related in some way to one another. For example, data about a person, including their name, age, job, etc.

**2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?**

- It's an efficient way of transfering a series of structured and related data items.

- It is easier to work with than arrays for identifying individual items by name.


**3. How do objects differ from arrays?**

Objects don't have indexes/index numbers; you instead use the name for each member's value. 

**4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.**

For example, you can't use dot notation to access an object property name held in a variable - but you can access the value with bracket notation.


**5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?**

`this` refers to the specific `const` declaration of `dog`, in this case, the data entered for `name` and `age` in this specific `const` (dog). 

The advantage is that you can specifically target each value of the `const`/object by name.

## Introduction to The DOM

**1. What is the DOM?**
The DOM is the Document Object Model - the data representation of the objects that compromise the structure and content of a document on the web.

**2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.**

The DOM is a Web API used to build websites - it's not part of JS language. The DOM is what is able to access the JS document and its elements. The DOM isn't a programming language, but it works with the JS input to create a model or notation of a given web page, HTML document, SVG document, and their component parts.
