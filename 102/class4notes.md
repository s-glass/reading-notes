### What is wireframing?

* A process to define and plan the information heirarchy of a web site/app/product's deisgn. Focus on how you want user to process your info, ideally using user research. Before building with code, designers and coders need the info laid out in black and white with buttons and menus in the diagrams. Style/design is pointless if a user can't navigate without it.

* **Wireframe examples** You can use a program or paper/whiteboard (easier to change, can test at every stage easier, can keep track of more detailed decisions).

* **things to consider** how much emphasis on visual design & how much uncertainty remains with the design

* **Examples of wireframe processes**
        * wireframe - interactive prototype - visual - design
        * sketch - code
        * sketch - wireframe - hi-def wireframe - visual - code
        * sketch - wireframe -visual - code

* **Tools**: free wireframe tools like UXPin, InVision, Wireframe.cc

### Six Steps 

1. Research 
        * look at UX trends and best practices, ID your user

2. Prepare for quick reference
        * Make note of key takeaways, reminders of best features, a few quotes from the audience

3. Map user flow

4. Draft & sketch vs. draw  or illustrate

5. Add detail and start testing

6. Turn wireframes into prototypes

### 3 Principles for good wireframing

1. Clarity

2. Confidence

3. Simplicity

### What is HTML and What is an element?

* HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language; it's a markup language that defines the structure of your contenet. It's composed of elements that are enclosed by using tags. 

* Main parts of the element are: 

1. Opening Tag

2. Closing Tag

3. Content

4. Attribute: attributes contain extra info on an element that you don't want to show in the content
        * Attributes always have:
                1. space between it and hte element name
                2. attribute name followed by =
                3. attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks

* Nesting elements: you can put elements inside other elements, called nesting. 

* Void elements: some elements have no content (i.e. '<img>' elements)

### Anatomy of HTML Document

* HTML: 

* Head

* Character Set - meta char set 

* Title

* Body

### Marking Up Text

* Links: 


## Semantics

* Semantics = the meaning of a piece of code; i.e. what effect or purpose does this line have? 

### JavaScript


### CSS


### HTML

* for example, '<h1>' is a semantic element; it gives the text it wraps meaning. 

* HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Styling is managed by CSS.

* Benefits of writing semantic markup:

1. search engines consider its contents important keywords (good for SEO)

2. Screen readers use it to signpost to assist visually impared users

3. Finding blocks of meaningful code is easier to see

4. Suggests to the dev the type of data expected to be populated

5. Semantic naming mirrors custom element/component naming
