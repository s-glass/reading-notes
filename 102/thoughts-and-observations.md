## Lab 03: Revisions and the Cloud ##

* This exercise has taught me to have patience, ask for help, and to not be afraid to try new tools. (or to be afraid, but just do it anyway).

* It's been difficult to make sure that I've got my files in the correct repositories, but with TA help I think I have things in the right place now.
