    1. Absolute: specify a location in relation to the root directory (begins with /)
    2. Relative: specify a location in relation to where you are in the system

## More About Files ##

Source: [https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)

* Everything is a file: text file/directory/keyboard = all files.
* Examples of File extensions:
    1. file.exe
    2. file.txt
    3. file.png / .gif / .jpg
* Linux is extensionless - so it ignores the extension
* file [path] will tell you the type of file in Linux

Tips:
* Linux is case sensitive
* Must be careful with spaces in names as spaces on the command line separate items
* Quotes around an entire item will keep them together
* Escape characters like (\) will escape or nullify the special meaning of the next character.

* Hidden Files
- To make a file hidden, you just have a file or directory name start with a "." ; do the reverse to make it unhidden.
- ls won't show hidden files, 
- use ls -a to show hidden files and directories
