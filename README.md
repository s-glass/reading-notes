## Growth Mindset
Having a growth mindset means that you believe that abilities come from dedication and hard work, as opposed to a fixed mindset, which believes qualities are fixed and success can come from talent alone. [^1]

In my professional life, prioritizing a growth mindset means that I'll be able to continually build skills and adapt to each work environment. 

### 3 Reminders for how I can keep a growth mindset are:
- **Reminder 1:** Remember times in the past that I've learned new, challenging skills.
- **Reminder 2:** Remember that growth is inevitable, and that staying still is boring. 
- **Reminder 3:** Remember that [Beyonc√©](https://beyonce.com/) definitely has a growth mindset, and that her talent plus the skills she's learned over the years are what have made her excel as an artist. üëë üêù

  > "I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am." - Beyonc√© Giselle Knowles-Carter [^2]
