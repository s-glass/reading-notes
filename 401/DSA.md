# 401 Prep: Data Structures and Algorithms


**Why this matters**: This information in the readings regarding DSA matters because without data structures you can't solve algorithms, and without algorithms, you can't find solutions to technical challenges.

**What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?**

Ideally, a programmer should consider (1) the operations performed, (2) the time complexity of operations, (3) the space complexity of operations, and (4) memory usage.

**How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?**

By allowing a set base condition to be true in a given recursive function call.
