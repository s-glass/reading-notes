**Why this matters**: This information matters because docker helps with organizing projects, it details how to create libraries with Django, and the differences between regular Django and Django REST frameworks.

------------------------------------

**1. What are the key components of a Docker container, and how do they help streamline the development and deployment of applications?**

- Image
- Containers
- Dockerfile
- Compose
- Registry

These components provide consistent environments, ensure application portability, simplify dependency management, and facilitate efficient collaboration among developers and operations teams, which results in faster and more reliable software development, testing, and production deployment workflows.

**3. Can you explain the primary differences between Django and Django REST framework?**

Django REST is a Django extension specifically used for building APIs, whereas Django is mostly used for building applications. Django focuses on rendering HTML pages vs Django REST, which focuses on creating APIs. Django REST extends regular Django authentication to handle API authentication and authorization. In regular Django, the default response format is HTML, whereas Django REST can handle many formats, primarily JSON.
