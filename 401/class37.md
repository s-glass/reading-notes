**2. After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?**

- The purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS is that it provides a set of pre-defined, single-purpose utility classes that can be directly applied to HTML elements in order to style them efficiently and quickly.  An example of how to use them to style an HTML element is to take a button, set it to a class, and add styling within double quotes in that <button> element.

**3. Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.**

- The main advantages of using Next.js for web development include SSR (server-side rendering), SSG (static site generation), CSR (client-side rendering), DX (developer experience), and built-in TypeScript Support. Traditional CSR websites tend to be slower to load, so this can impact site SEO as some search engines may not wait for the JS to load and render the content. SSR in Next.js provides fully rendered HTML, which is easy for search engines to find.
