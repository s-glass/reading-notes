# 401 class 09 notes

**Why this matters**: This information matters because it gives us more information about dunder methods, discusses an important ethical topic regarding attribution, and introduces the statistics module and many of its methods.

------------------------------------

**1. What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method.**

Dunder methods allow you to emulate the behavior of built-in types. Common examples are __init__ and __str__.

**2. In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?**

He created a machine learning course through Udacity that included stolen code from GitHub. This could have been avoided with proper attribution, including forking vs cloning repositories. (That blonde streak in his hair? A close second ethical concern.)

**3. Describe the Python statistics module and give an example of a function within the module that can be used to perform a common statistical operation.**

It's a built-in module that can be used to calculate mathematical statistics of numeric data. For example, `statistics.harmonic_mean()` calculates the central location of the given data.
