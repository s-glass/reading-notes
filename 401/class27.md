# 401 class 27 notes

**Why this matters**: This information matters because Django's componenets and workflow allow users to - relatively easily -  build dynamic web apps and interactive databases.

------------------------------------

**1. Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?**

Models refer to Python objects through which Django web applications are able to access and manage data. Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc.

Once you've chosen what database you want to use, you don't need to talk to it directly — you just write your model structure and other code, and Django will communicate with the database for you.

ChatGPT says this is the basic strucutre of a model, where each attribute of the model class represents a database field:

```python
from django.db import models

class YourModelName(models.Model):
    # Define model fields
    field1 = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    field2 = models.IntegerField()
    # Add more fields as needed

    # Optionally, add methods (functions) to encapsulate behavior or custom queries
    def some_method(self):
        # Some logic here
        return something
```

**2. Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?**

The Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records

Primary features include:
- CRUD operations
- Automatic form generation
- Search and filtering capabilities
- List and detail views for all instances of a model
- User permissions and authentication
- Custom actions can be defined to perform specific tasks on specific model instances, like exporting data or updating records in bulk

It can be customized to match the needs of a project, including layout, views, overriding default templates, AdminSite and ModelAdmin classes, etc.

**3. Briefly outline the key components and workflow of a Django application, as discussed in the Beginner’s Guide to Django. How do these components interact with each other to create a functional web application?**

Some key components of a Django application include models, admin, views, templates, and URLs. 

- Models: represent the data structure of the application and define the database schema.
- Admin: allows for CRUD, form generation, user authentication, etc.
- Views: handle user requests and determine what data to display.
- Templates: are HTML files with embedded Django template language that defines the presentation of the data.
- URL config: maps URLS to views in the application. Defines routing for user requests and tells Django what view to use to handle a specific URL.

The components interact with each other in the following ways:

- The URL configurations direct requests to the appropriate view, based on the URLs defined in the Django project.
- The view functions process the requests, including data retrieval, manipulation, and template rendering.
- Views interact with models to retrieve and store data in the database.
- Templates receive data from the views and generate dynamic HTML content to be displayed to the user.
- The user interacts with the webpages generated by the templates, triggering further requests and responses in the application.
