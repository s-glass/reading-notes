# 401 Prep: The Growth Mindset

**Why this matters**: This information matters because having a Growth Mindset and a critical perspective on concepts like practice, grit, success, emotional intelligence, and personal biases can make a significant difference in important workplace areas like goal setting, overcoming challenges, finding creative solutions, working in teams, and improving as an individual in the workplace.

## Growth Mindset
Having a growth mindset means that you believe that abilities come from dedication and hard work, as opposed to a fixed mindset, which believes qualities are fixed and success can come from talent alone. [Source](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)

In my professional life, prioritizing a growth mindset means that I'll be able to continually build skills and adapt to each work environment.

### 3 Reminders for how I can keep a growth mindset are:
- **Reminder 1:** Remember times in the past that I've learned new, challenging skills.
- **Reminder 2:** Remember that growth is inevitable, and that staying still is boring.
- **Reminder 3:** Think of successful public figures (such as my personal fave, Beyonc√©), and remember that her talent plus the skills she's learned over the years are what have made her excel as an artist. üëë üêù
