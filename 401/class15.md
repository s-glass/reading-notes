**Why this matters**: This information matters because trees are data structures that we can use to solve technical problems!

------------------------------------

Trees are sort of like family trees, except with weird societal rules.

Binary trees live in a world where everybody who has at least one kid is a single parent and there's a two child max law. If a node has two kids, one must be left-handed and one must be right-handed. Not everybody will have kids, and some will have one.

K-ary trees live in a world where they can have 0 up to K number of kids. They're also always single parents, and there's no rules about whether kids are left or right-handed.

For both, the root node is the matriarch/patriarch/theytriarch, and they can dequeue to go on vacation from their crazy family. When this happens, all of the monarch's children are enqueued into a queue, and when the first child dequeues the queue, that first child's kids then get enqueued to the back of the queueue, behind it's aunts and uncles. This dequeue/enqueue process happens at the front of the queue until the queueu is empty of children.
