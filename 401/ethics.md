- This relates to tech ethics because it discusses the ways that tech can harm vulnerable populations and interfere with and prevent human rights.
- I agree with the Microsoft employees in the article. I believe they have a right to raise concerns over ethical issues in their work and to protest the harmful impacts of their products.
- What stuck out to me was that this affected Microsoft employees globally, not just in the United States.

- This relates to tech ethics because it covers scenarios when a self-driving car could effectively choose who to harm when an accident is unavoidable.
- It raises the issue of tech being created and put into effect before anyone is even seriously considering the potential ramifications, and after it's too late to go back and fix issues.
- It also mentions that the issue isn't purely about ethics, but also about control, and the way people behave in theory versus in practice.
- What was surprising (or more, interesting) was that a research group decided to "protect" humans outside of the car unless they themselves were in the car, in which they decided to protect the car passengers at all costs.
